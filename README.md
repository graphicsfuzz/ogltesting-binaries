# ogltesting-binaries
The binaries used in the Graphics Fuzz project as a Maven package. 

For now, the binaries are checked in manually after executing the scripts in the root (`1_download_files.sh`, etc.).
You can execute the scripts to download, unzip, and copy the binaries to their final location.
